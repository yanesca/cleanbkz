cleanbkz is a library to find short vectors in a lattice. Once finished 
it will contain an improved enumeration algorithm using extreme pruning,
the bkz2.0 and probably an improved random sampler algorithm. 

To compile and test it, you can follow these steps:

------------------------
1. Compile cleanbkz sources
------------------------

cleanbkz requires the NTL library. Version 5.4.2 (or higher) is needed. 
Once you have NTL installed, execute:

$ cmake .
$ make

Now both the library and the tests are compiled. You can find the test
executables in the bin/ folder.


------------------------
2. Generate documentation 
------------------------

The source files are annotated for doxygen documentation. To generate
the documentation, first install doxygen and then execute:

$ make doc

Now the documentation is in the doc/ folder.


------------------------
3. File extensions and formats
------------------------

.lat	These are the data files generated by the lattice_gen tool and
	contain the lattice basis in NTL's output format. 

.plt	Boundary function generated by the boudtool application in a form
	readable by gnuplot.

.bnd	Boundary function in NTL's format. It is usually created by 
	copying the corresponding line from a .plt file.
